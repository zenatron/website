## Project Overview

This project tackles a **multi-class classification problem**: predicting car brands based on vehicle characteristics. It demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset of vehicles with various features (engine size, horsepower, fuel efficiency, price, etc.), build a classification model that can accurately predict the manufacturer brand.

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Handling categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Addressing class imbalance

### Model Development
Multiple classification algorithms are implemented and compared:
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline linear model
- **Decision Trees**: Non-linear decision boundaries
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning approach
- **Support Vector Machines**: Maximum margin classifier
- **k-Nearest Neighbors**: Instance-based learning

### Evaluation Strategy

<Callout type="success">
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple metrics ensures robust model selection.
</Callout>

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision & Recall**: Per-class performance
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed error analysis
- **Cross-Validation**: Generalization performance

## Results & Insights

The project includes:
- Comparative analysis of algorithm performance
- Feature importance rankings
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Discussion of model trade-offs

## Key Learnings
