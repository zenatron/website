## Project Overview

This capstone project demonstrates **unsupervised learning** through clustering analysis of wine varieties. Without labeled data, the goal is to discover natural groupings based on chemical properties.

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset of wines with various chemical measurements (acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol percentage, etc.), use clustering algorithms to identify distinct wine groups and understand what chemical characteristics define each cluster.

## Dataset Features

### Chemical Properties
- **Fixed Acidity**: Tartaric acid concentration
- **Volatile Acidity**: Acetic acid concentration
- **Citric Acid**: Adds freshness and flavor
- **Residual Sugar**: Remaining sugar after fermentation
- **Chlorides**: Salt content
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Prevents microbial growth
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Free + bound forms
- **Density**: Related to sugar and alcohol content
- **pH**: Acidity/alkalinity measure
- **Sulphates**: Wine additive
- **Alcohol**: Percentage by volume

## Clustering Approach

### Algorithms Implemented

<Callout type="success">
Multiple clustering algorithms are compared to find the most meaningful wine groupings.
</Callout>

- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitioning into k clusters
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Building a cluster dendrogram
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Probabilistic clustering

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Dimensionality reduction with PCA
   - Outlier detection and handling

2. **Optimal Cluster Selection**
   - Elbow method
   - Silhouette analysis
   - Dendrogram visualization

3. **Cluster Analysis**
   - Profile each cluster by feature means
   - Visualize clusters in 2D/3D space
   - Interpret cluster characteristics

4. **Validation**
   - Silhouette score
   - Davies-Bouldin index
   - Calinski-Harabasz score

## Results & Insights

The project delivers:
- Identification of distinct wine groups
- Chemical profile of each cluster
- Visual representations of clustering results
- Comparison of clustering algorithms
- Recommendations based on cluster characteristics

## Key Findings

<Callout type="info">
Unsupervised learning reveals patterns that might not be apparent through manual inspection.
</Callout>
