# Projects System Documentation

This page serves as both documentation and a live example of the custom projects system. Use this as a reference when creating your own project pages.

<Callout type="info">
**Quick Start**: Copy this file, update the frontmatter, and write your content. That's it!
</Callout>

## Frontmatter Reference

The frontmatter (the YAML block at the top between `---`) controls your project's metadata and features. Here are all available options:

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Your Project Title"           # Displayed as the main heading
description: "Brief description"       # Shown on project cards and in meta tags
type: "web"                           # Options: "web", "data", "game", "other"
slug: "your-project-slug"             # URL will be /projects/your-project-slug
---
```

### Optional Fields

#### Dates & Featured Status
```yaml
date: "2025-10-16"                    # ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD), shows on project page
featured: true                         # Highlights project on main projects page
```

#### Tags
```yaml
tags: ["react", "typescript", "nextjs"]  # Array of strings, creates tag bubbles
```

#### Images
```yaml
image: "/images/projects/hero.jpg"    # Main featured image (full width at top)
images:                                # Image gallery (shown below content)
  - "/images/projects/screenshot1.jpg"
  - "/images/projects/screenshot2.jpg"
  - "/images/projects/screenshot3.jpg"
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Image Paths**: All images should be in `public/images/projects/` and referenced with absolute paths starting with `/images/...`
</Callout>

#### Videos
```yaml
video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"  # Main featured video
# OR for local video:
video: "/videos/demo.mp4"

# For multiple videos (shown in gallery):
videos:
  - "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_1"
  - "/videos/demo1.mp4"
  - "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_2"
```

**Video Tips**:
- YouTube: Use embed URL format: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`
- Local videos: Place in `public/videos/` folder, use MP4 or WebM format
- Featured video appears at top, additional videos appear in gallery section

#### Links
```yaml
github: "https://github.com/username/repo"        # GitHub repository link
demoUrl: "https://your-demo.vercel.app"          # Live demo/deployment link
# OR use 'live' instead of 'demoUrl':
live: "https://your-demo.vercel.app"             # Same as demoUrl
```

These create buttons in the header of your project page.

#### Downloads
```yaml
downloads:
  - filename: "project-files.zip"
    label: "Download Source"          # Optional: defaults to filename
  - filename: "documentation.pdf"
    label: "Documentation"
  - filename: "notebook.ipynb"
    label: "Jupyter Notebook"
```

**How it works**:
- Files should be in `public/downloads/` folder
- **Single file**: Shows a simple download button
- **Multiple files**: Shows an elegant dropdown with checkboxes
  - Users can select which files to download
  - Select/deselect all option
  - Shows file count (e.g., "Downloads (2/3)")
  - Downloads selected files individually

Perfect for projects with multiple resources like code files, notebooks, datasets, documentation, etc.

#### GitHub Integration (Enhanced Projects)
```yaml
githubRepo: "username/repo-name"      # Automatically fetches and displays README
```

When you add `githubRepo`, the README from that repository will be automatically fetched and displayed **below** your custom MDX content. This is perfect for adding context, explanations, or additional media to complement the technical README.

## Complete Example

Here's a full-featured frontmatter example showing all options:

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Full-Stack App"
description: "A comprehensive web application showcasing modern development practices"
type: "web"
slug: "awesome-fullstack-app"
date: "2025-10-16"
featured: true
tags: ["react", "typescript", "nextjs", "tailwind", "postgresql"]
image: "/images/projects/app-hero.jpg"
images:
  - "/images/projects/app-dashboard.jpg"
  - "/images/projects/app-mobile.jpg"
video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
github: "https://github.com/username/awesome-app"
demoUrl: "https://awesome-app.vercel.app"
downloads:
  - filename: "app-documentation.pdf"
    label: "Documentation"
  - filename: "app-source.zip"
    label: "Source Code"
githubRepo: "username/awesome-app"
---
```

## Project Types

Choose the type that best describes your project:

| Type | Description | Common Use Cases |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `"web"` | Web applications, sites | React apps, Next.js sites, landing pages |
| `"data"` | Data science, analysis | Jupyter notebooks, ML projects, visualizations |
| `"game"` | Games, interactive experiences | Unity projects, web games, simulations |
| `"other"` | Everything else | Tools, scripts, documentation, experiments |

The type doesn't affect functionality, but helps users understand what kind of project it is at a glance.

---

## MDX Content Features

After the frontmatter, you can use all standard Markdown plus these enhanced features:

### 1. Markdown Basics

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bullet lists
- Like this

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this

[Links](https://example.com)

> Blockquotes for emphasis
```

### 2. Code Blocks

```typescript
// Syntax highlighting works automatically
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return true;
}
```

Supports many languages: `javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `java`, `bash`, `css`, `html`, etc.

### 3. Math Equations (KaTeX)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Display math:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

More complex:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)
$$

### 4. React Components

You can import and use React components in your MDX:

#### Counter Component

<Counter />

#### Callout Component

<Callout type="info">
**Info**: Use this for helpful information or tips.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Warning**: Use this for important warnings or gotchas.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
**Error**: Use this for critical information or errors to avoid.
</Callout>

To use these, import them at the top of your MDX file:

```mdx
import Counter from '@/components/mdx/Counter';
import Callout from '@/components/mdx/Callout';
```

### 5. Tables

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Images | ✅ | PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG |
| Videos | ✅ | YouTube, local MP4/WebM |
| Math | ✅ | KaTeX for LaTeX equations |
| Code | ✅ | Syntax highlighting |
| Components | ✅ | React components |

### 6. Task Lists

- [x] Feature implemented
- [x] Tests written
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Deployment ready

## File Structure

When creating a project, organize your files like this:

```
src/content/projects/
  └── my-awesome-project.mdx        # Your project file

public/
  ├── images/projects/
  │   ├── my-project-hero.jpg       # Featured image
  │   ├── screenshot1.jpg           # Gallery images
  │   └── screenshot2.jpg
  ├── videos/
  │   └── my-project-demo.mp4       # Video files
  └── downloads/
      ├── documentation.pdf          # Downloadable files
      └── source-code.zip
```

---

## Project Types Guide

### Custom MDX Project (like this one)
- **File**: `your-project.mdx` in `src/content/projects/`
- **Shows**: Your custom MDX content only
- **Best for**: Projects needing lots of context, explanations, media

### GitHub Project (No MDX)
- **File**: None needed - auto-fetched from GitHub
- **Shows**: Repository README only
- **URL**: `/projects/github-repo-name`
- **Best for**: Quick showcase of GitHub repos

### Enhanced GitHub Project (With MDX)
- **File**: `github-repo-name.mdx` in `src/content/projects/`
- **Shows**: Your custom content + GitHub README
- **Best for**: Adding context, demos, or media to GitHub projects
- Include `githubRepo: "username/repo"` in frontmatter

### Jupyter Notebook Project
- **File**: `notebook-name.html` + optional `notebook-name.mdx`
- **Shows**: Rendered notebook + optional custom content
- **Best for**: Data science projects, analysis, visualizations

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Writing Good Descriptions
- Keep under 160 characters for SEO
- Be specific about what the project does
- Mention key technologies if relevant

### 2. Choosing Tags
- Use lowercase
- Be consistent across projects (e.g., always `"typescript"` not `"TypeScript"`)
- Include main language/framework
- Add 3-5 relevant tags maximum

### 3. Images
- Use descriptive filenames: `project-dashboard.jpg` not `img1.jpg`
- Optimize images (< 500KB each)
- Use 16:9 aspect ratio for featured images (1200x675px recommended)
- Use consistent aspect ratios for gallery images

### 4. Slugs
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Be descriptive but concise: `weather-app` not `a`
- Avoid changing slugs after publishing (breaks links)
- For GitHub projects, prefix with `github-` automatically

### 5. Content Organization
```markdown
# Start with Overview
Explain what the project is and why it exists.

## Show the Problem
What issue does this solve?

## Demonstrate the Solution
Screenshots, videos, code examples.

## Technical Details
Architecture, tech stack, interesting decisions.

## Future Plans
What's next for the project?
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Embed Local Video
```mdx
<video src="/videos/demo.mp4" controls className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-8" />
```

### Image with Caption
```mdx
![Dashboard view](/images/projects/dashboard.jpg)
*Figure 1: The main dashboard showing real-time data visualization*
```

### Multi-column Layout
```mdx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div>
    **Column 1**
    Content here
  </div>
  <div>
    **Column 2**
    Content here
  </div>
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

**Project not showing up?**
- Check frontmatter syntax (valid YAML)
- Ensure `slug` is unique
- File must have `.mdx` extension
- Check for TypeScript/build errors

**Images not loading?**
- Use absolute paths: `/images/projects/...`
- Files must be in `public/` directory
- Check spelling and case sensitivity

**Math not rendering?**
- Use single `$` for inline: `$E = mc^2$`
- Use double `$$` for display (on own lines)
- Escape special characters if needed: `\$100`

**Components not working?**
- Import at top of file
- Check component name matches import
- Ensure component is in `src/components/mdx/`
