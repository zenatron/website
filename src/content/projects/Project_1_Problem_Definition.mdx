## Project Overview

This project focuses on the critical first phase of any data mining task: **problem definition and exploratory data analysis**. Understanding your data is the foundation for successful modeling and analysis.

## Objectives

### Problem Understanding
- Define clear research questions and objectives
- Identify the target variable and relevant features
- Establish success criteria and evaluation metrics

### Data Exploration
- Examine dataset structure and characteristics
- Identify data types and distributions
- Detect missing values and outliers
- Understand relationships between variables

### Visualization
- Create informative visualizations to reveal patterns
- Use appropriate chart types for different data types
- Build a narrative through visual storytelling

## Methodology

<Callout type="info">
A well-defined problem is half-solved. This project emphasizes the importance of thorough planning before diving into modeling.
</Callout>

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and loading the dataset
2. **Initial Inspection**: Understanding data structure and quality
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Computing descriptive statistics
4. **Visual Exploration**: Creating plots and charts
5. **Insight Generation**: Documenting findings and hypotheses
6. **Plan Development**: Outlining next steps for analysis
