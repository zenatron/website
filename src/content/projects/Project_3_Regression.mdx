## Project Overview

This project explores **regression analysis** by predicting song popularity based on audio features. It demonstrates how to build predictive models for continuous target variables.

## Problem Statement

Using audio features from Spotify's API (such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, valence), predict a song's popularity score. This is a practical application of regression in the music industry.

## Dataset Features

### Audio Characteristics
- **Danceability**: How suitable a track is for dancing
- **Energy**: Intensity and activity measure
- **Loudness**: Overall volume in decibels
- **Speechiness**: Presence of spoken words
- **Acousticness**: Confidence measure of acoustic sound
- **Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains vocals
- **Tempo**: Beats per minute (BPM)
- **Valence**: Musical positiveness

## Methodology

### Feature Engineering
<Callout type="info">
Creating meaningful features is often more important than choosing the right algorithm.
</Callout>

- Polynomial features for capturing non-linear relationships
- Interaction terms between related features
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Handling outliers and skewed distributions

### Models Implemented
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model
- **Ridge Regression**: L2 regularization
- **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization with feature selection
- **Polynomial Regression**: Capturing non-linear patterns
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Ensemble approach

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared prediction error
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Interpretable error metric
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute prediction error
- **R² Score**: Proportion of variance explained

## Results & Analysis

The project includes:
- Comparison of model performance
- Feature importance analysis
- Residual plots and diagnostics
- Predictions vs. actual values visualization
- Discussion of model limitations

## Key Insights

- Which audio features most influence popularity
- Trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability
- Impact of regularization on model performance
- Importance of proper validation strategies

## Applications

Regression techniques are used in:
- Price prediction (real estate, stocks)
- Sales forecasting
- Risk assessment
- Demand prediction
- Performance optimization
