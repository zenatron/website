# Self‑Hosting With Tailscale: Secure Access Without Open Ports

Self‑hosting is empowering — but opening ports on your router can feel like hanging a neon sign that says “Please scan me.” There’s a better way: **private access via Tailscale**. If you’re new here, [self‑hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) just means running services on hardware you control.

## Why self‑host in the first place?

- **Control**: Your data stays on *your* hardware.
- **Customization**: Configure services how you want.
- **Reliability**: Avoid vendor lock‑in.

If you’re new to the concept of VPNs, start with [What Is a VPN?](/blog/what-is-a-vpn).

## The threat model most people ignore

The average self‑hoster isn’t being targeted by a nation‑state. The real risks are **opportunistic scans**, **default passwords**, and **unpatched services**. Your goal is to make your box a *terrible* target for drive‑by attacks.

## The risk of open ports

Classic self‑hosting guides say: “forward port 443 to your server.” That works, but it exposes your box to the entire internet. A safer default is to **not** expose anything publicly unless you must. If you’re unfamiliar with the term, [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) is essentially poking a hole through your router’s [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation).

If you do open ports, you’ve moved from “private” to “internet‑facing.” That’s when you need stronger patching discipline, monitoring, and rate‑limiting.

<Callout type="warning" title="Rule of thumb" showEmoji={true}>
If the service is just for you (or your household), keep it private. Public exposure should be deliberate, not accidental.
</Callout>

## The Tailscale pattern (private by default)

Tailscale gives you:

- **Encrypted access** between your devices
- **Identity‑based access control** (people, groups, tags)
- **Zero port forwarding** for private services

This makes home services feel like they’re “on the same Wi‑Fi,” even when you’re across the world.

The biggest win is that your services **aren’t visible** to the public internet at all. Most automated scans never even see the box.

## A practical setup flow

### 1) Install Tailscale on your server

- Linux: [Tailscale install guide](https://tailscale.com/download)
- Docker‑only? You can run the daemon in a container as well.

### 2) Install Tailscale on your laptop/phone

Sign in with the same identity provider to join the tailnet.

### 3) Turn on MagicDNS

This gives you friendly hostnames (e.g., `media.tailnet`) instead of IPs.

### 4) Lock it down with ACLs

Even within your tailnet, you can restrict access by device or user.

```json
{
  "acls": [
    {"action": "accept", "src": ["group:family"], "dst": ["tag:media:*"]}
  ],
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:media": ["group:admins"]
  }
}
```

### 5) (Optional) Use Tailscale SSH

If you want to avoid copying SSH keys around, enable Tailscale SSH so access is tied to your identity provider and device posture.

### 6) (Optional) Use a subnet router

If you have devices that *can’t* run Tailscale (smart TVs, printers), a subnet router advertises that LAN into your tailnet.

## Example services that are perfect for this

- **Jellyfin** or **Plex** for media
- **Home Assistant** for smart home dashboards
- **Paperless‑ngx** for document storage
- **Grafana** for monitoring your stack

Here’s a favorite self‑hosting resource: [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/)

## Backups are not optional

If it’s worth hosting, it’s worth backing up. A basic rule: **[3‑2‑1 backups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#3-2-1_rule)** (three copies, two different media, one off‑site). Even a cheap external drive plus an encrypted cloud backup is better than nothing.

## When you *do* need public access

Sometimes a service must be public (a personal site, a demo, a webhook endpoint). In that case, I still prefer a layered setup:

- Put it behind a **[reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)** (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik).
- Terminate **TLS** there and keep internal services private.
- Rate‑limit or require auth for anything that isn’t meant for the world.

If you want a quick, clean way to do this, look into **[Caddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy_(web_server))** — it handles HTTPS automatically and is very easy to configure.

## Security layers that still matter

Tailscale solves the **network access** problem, but you still want good app‑level hygiene:

- **[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)** for any web UI, even inside your tailnet.
- **[MFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)** on your identity provider.
- **App‑level auth** (don’t leave dashboards wide open).
- A basic **[firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))** on the server for defense in depth.

## Updates and patching (the boring part that saves you)

Most real‑world compromises happen because something wasn’t updated. Set a reminder, automate updates where safe, and **subscribe to release notes** for the apps you expose.

## Monitoring and logs (so you notice problems early)

Even a tiny homelab benefits from basic **[logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_file)** and metrics. At minimum, make sure you can answer: *“Is the service up?”* and *“Did it just restart?”* Tools like Grafana + Prometheus are great, but a simple uptime check and journal logs are often enough.

## Troubleshooting checklist

- **Can’t connect?** Check the Tailscale status page and confirm both devices show “active.”
- **High latency?** You might be relayed through DERP; try a different network or check NAT settings.
- **DNS issues?** Confirm MagicDNS is enabled and your device uses the Tailscale DNS settings.
- **App unreachable?** Check local firewall rules and service bindings (is it listening on `0.0.0.0` or just `localhost`?).

Give your servers tags and friendly names early. You’ll thank yourself later when you’re SSH‑ing from a phone.

## Summary

Tailscale makes private access to self‑hosted services feel effortless — and safer. If you care about remote access without exposing your server to the entire internet, this is the cleanest path I’ve found.
